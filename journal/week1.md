# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

## Testing apps
I have tested both apps (frontend & backend) running inside Gitpod. Some issues as I'm not a developer and I only have basic knowledge of python. 

## Creating containers
I have created Dockerfile for both environments using examples from instructions. Previous Youtube Docker training has been really useful.

## Docker-compose
Using docker-compose file to build and deploy all containers together. I need to understand better how volumes work.

## Update code with notifications as in the Andrew's videos.
Basically cut&paste from examples, trying to understand how it works. Tested

## Database
Added db containers to the environment.
